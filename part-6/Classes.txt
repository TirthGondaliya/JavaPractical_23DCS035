1. Classes:
User: Represents a user who can register and vote in the system. Each user has a username and password.
Candidate: Represents a candidate in the election. A candidate has a name, a party, and keeps track of the number of votes received.
Election: Manages the list of candidates and handles vote casting and result display for a specific election (e.g., "2024 Election").
Voting System: The main class that handles user registration, voting, candidate management, and the overall flow of the election.

2. Core Functionalities:
User Registration: Users can register with a username and password to participate in the election.
Authentication: When voting, the system authenticates the user by checking their username and password.
Add Candidates: Admin can add new candidates to the election by providing their name and party.
Vote Casting: A registered user can cast their vote for a candidate. The system prevents a user from voting more than once by maintaining a list of votedUsers.
Vote Confirmation: Before casting a vote, the system asks the user for confirmation (yes/no).
Display Results: After voting, the election results can be displayed, showing the number of votes for each candidate.
Display Candidates: Users can view a list of all candidates participating in the election. 

3. Console Menu:
The system provides a text-based interface with the following menu options:

Register a user.
Add a candidate.
Cast a vote (with authentication).
View the election results.
View the list of candidates.
Exit the system.

4. Set and List:
The code uses a List (specifically ArrayList) to manage collections of users and candidates.
It uses a Set (specifically HashSet) to keep track of users who have already voted, ensuring that no user votes multiple times.

5. Clearing the Console:
There is a clearConsole() method that attempts to clear the console screen for both Windows and Unix-based systems, enhancing the user experience by providing a clean interface each time the menu is shown.


6. Main Method:
The main() method drives the program. It continuously displays the menu, takes user input, and performs actions based on the selected option until the user chooses to exit.

This system mimics a basic voting process that could be used for elections, complete with user authentication, vote casting, and result display functionalities.
